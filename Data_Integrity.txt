     Data Integrity:
     The following categories of the data integrity exist with each RDBMS:
    
     - Entity Integrity : There are no duplicate rows in a table.
     - Domain Integrity : Enforces valid entries for a given column by restricting the type, the format, or the range of values.
     - Referential Integrity : Rows cannot be deleted which are used by other records.
     - User-Defined Integrity : Enforces some specific business rules that do not fall into entity, domain, or referential integrity.
